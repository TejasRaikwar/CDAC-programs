
1.	Because of budget issues, the HR department needs a report that displays the last name and salary of employees earning more than $12,000.
-->
mysql> select last_name, salary from employees where salary > 12000;
+-----------+----------+
| last_name | salary   |
+-----------+----------+
| King      | 24000.00 |

| Russell   | 14000.00 |
| Partners  | 13500.00 |
| Hartstein | 13000.00 |
+-----------+----------+

2.	Open a new SQL Worksheet. Create a report that displays the last name and department number for employee number 176.
-->
mysql> select e.last_name, d.department_name from employees e, departments d where  employee_id=176;
+-----------+----------------------+
| last_name | department_name      |
